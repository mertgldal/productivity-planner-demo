1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js (LTS version recommended)
    * NPM or Yarn
    * Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli` (if not already installed)
    * A physical device with the Expo Go app or an Android/iOS emulator.
    * (For native builds/certain scenarios without Android Studio): Correctly configured Android SDK (including Platform Tools and a JDK like OpenJDK 17) with `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables set, and relevant SDK directories added to the system PATH.

2.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/mertgldal/productivity-planner-demo>
    cd mobile_app 
    ```
    
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(or `yarn install`)*

4.  **Run the application:**
    * To start the development server and see options (QR code for Expo Go, run on emulator/device):
        ```bash
        npm start 
        ```
        *(or `expo start`)*
    * To directly attempt to run on an Android emulator/device:
        ```bash
        npm run android
        ```
        *(or `expo start --android`)*
    * To directly attempt to run on an iOS simulator/device (macOS only):
        ```bash
        npm run ios
        ```
        *(or `expo start --ios`)*

## üìù Project Structure (Expo Router)

The app uses Expo Router, with main navigation defined in `app/_layout.tsx` and route groups:
* `app/(auth)/`: Contains login and register screens.
* `app/(app)/`: Contains the main application screens accessible after authentication.
* `src/`: Contains reusable components, Zustand stores, type definitions, and utility functions.
